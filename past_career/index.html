        <blockquote>
  <p>I can’t understand a word you’re saying. Why don’t you learn to speak English?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t forget the day Jak marched through the office area, angrily requesting me to accompany back into the warehouse. We walked down the thin, dimly lit hallway that opened up to hectic rows of stacked boxes and forklifts bustling about. In the loading zone, we were confronted by an angry woman. Trying to calm her down, Oscar said, “Ma’am, I understand his English perfectly.” She brushed it off with a sneer. Oscar was in his 40s, Mexican, and one of the three workers with a forklift operating license. Jak was ethnically Chinese, but a Burmese national. The woman who had driven thousands of miles across the country was older and white. The warehouse was a daily intersectional microcosm of society, a place where we all had our own struggles, but tried to work with each other to get past them.</p>

<p>Technically, my role on paper was just to receive purchase orders, figure out which we had inventory for, and arrange for pickup. But being in that situation also meant that more responsibility landed on my shoulders. For instance, I was the primary contact between four parties: <em>routers</em> that scheduled <em>carriers</em> to pick up and deliver loads to <em>distributors</em>, and our <em>supervisors</em>. That means that it was up to me to call and email the right people to solve the problems that couldn’t be handled by any particular side.</p>

<p>On that day, I called the Wal-mart routing person and the carrier to schedule a replacement for an uncooperative driver. Then on another day, I called the distribution center to report that we accidentally swapped two loads, that needed their paperwork swapped, and notified the router. <strong>These problems needed to be solved with a little bit of creativity and a lot of communication.</strong></p>

<p>When I first took this role, Dumar (later rebranded to <a href="https://ballardpacific.com/" target="blank">Ballard Pacific</a>) was a small Taiwanese company that had just expanded its operation to the States. They sold to major retailers like Wal-mart and Target, and wanted to control logistical costs. But they had no technical experience. Per the agreement with small vendors, we logged into retailers’ <a href="https://retaillink.wal-mart.com" target="blank">websites</a> and downloaded purchase orders every morning, then manually entered information into Excel to subtract stock from our inventories. Repetitive entry was prone to human error, so a couple weeks after I started, I wrote Excel macros that expanded into full programs (in VB6 at the time) that pattern matched the orders. Soon, we were able to automatically generate shipping documents and invoice, and integrate label printing and routing. Since I wrote these programs, it also became my job to make sure all the software was working correctly. The company was set to hire a dozen more laborers to prepare documents, but that plan was scrapped. To this day, there was never more than 3! We were able to go from 10 loads a day that year to more than 60.</p>

<p>Logistics is a constrained optimization problem. From the outside, it sounds dirty and evokes images of underpaid manual laborers pushing boxes. There’s some of that, but it’s also surprisingly creative and rewarding. I got to meet people from across the country and solve some challenging problems that put millions of dollars on the line. But these processes are misunderstood and often undervalued. I loved to solve the problems, but from working with people up and down the supply chain, I saw inefficiencies that I could never address just dealing with daily operations. I wanted to do more, and be given more responsibility, but my role on paper was just that.</p>

<p>These problems begin in the design… of the boxes, the instruction manual, the orientation of the boxes during shipping, the spare parts and forecasting, and the software. I knew I wanted to become an engineer, so I quit my job and went back to school.</p>
